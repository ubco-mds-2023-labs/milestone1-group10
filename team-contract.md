# Team Work Contract

## General Committment to Work Ethic

Our group has decided to as best as possible split the work evenly among each group member. We have decided to use a parallel appraoch when working together. What this entails:
- All members will work on ALL stages of the project in parallel
  - This means that all members will be working on each compenent. For example: All members will in some form work with the data exploration, wrangling, and manupulation. All members will have contributed to generating at least 1 of the tabs of the dash plotly app. Finally, all members will have a working branch that they can push to and commit to main from.

## Meetings
- Our team will meet as frequently as we deem necessary
- Our team sits in close proximity with each other in class and so we will communicate frequently in that regard
- For meetings that require more extensive work-up, meetings will be conducted over Zoom and a meeting link will be distributed ~1 hour before the meeting of an agreed period.

## GitHub practices
- Members are expected to have their own working branch which they can then merge to main through a pull request

## Working hours
- Work hours are left to the individual members of the team
- We work on a policy that as long as the work is completed on time and of good quality, then each member will govern their own work hours
